On March 10th, we hosted a meetup in Pakhuis de Zwijger in Amsterdam on automating modern datacenters. Thanks to all of you, and specifically the [Docker Randstad meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Randstad/), the venue was packed! Mitchell Hashimoto of [Hashicorp](https://hashicorp.com/), the creator of tools like Vagrant, Consul and Terraform, joined us and delivered a very interesting talk about his vision on automating datacenters. He also joined us during the hands-on session where we showed how you can use Docker in conjunction with Consul and Vagrant to create production-like load-balanced environments, right on your laptop.
