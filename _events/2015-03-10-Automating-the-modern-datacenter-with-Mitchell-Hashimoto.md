On March 10th, we hosted a meetup in Pakhuis de Zwijger in Amsterdam on automating modern data centers. Thanks to all of you guys and gals from the [Dutch Devops Engineers](http://www.meetup.com/devops-engineers/) and the [Docker Randstad](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Randstad/) meetup groups the venue was packed! Mitchell Hashimoto of [Hashicorp](https://hashicorp.com/), the creator of tools like Vagrant, Consul and Terraform, joined us and delivered a very interesting talk about his vision on automating data centers. He also joined us during the hands-on session where we showed how you can use Docker in conjunction with Consul and Vagrant to create production-like load-balanced environments, right on your laptop.
